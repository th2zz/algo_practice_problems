Description
Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins.

If there is no cycle, return null.

Example
Example 1:

Input:

null, no cycle
Output:

no cycle
Explanation:

List is null, so no cycle.
Example 2:

Input:

-21->10->4->5ï¼Œtail connects to node index 1
Output:

10
Explanation:

The last node 5 points to the node whose index is 1, which is 10, so the entrance of the ring is 10

Challenge
Can you solve it without using extra space?
