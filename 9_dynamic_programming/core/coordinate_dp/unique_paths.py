    Description
Follow up for "Unique Paths":
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a mxn grid.

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

1≤n≤100
1≤m≤100

Example
Example 1:

Input:

obstacleGrid = [[0]]
Output:

1
Explanation:

There's only one point

Example 2:

Input:

obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output:

2
Explanation:

Only 2 different path
    @param obstacle_grid: A list of lists of integers
    @return: An integer
